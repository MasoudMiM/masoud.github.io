<p>I used to love tinkering with my toys as a kid, always curious about how things worked. There was something somewhat satisfying about taking apart a gadget and putting it back together, like I was unlocking a little mystery. I guess there’s a reason I ended up in the engineering field. Back then—and I’m really not that old!—handymen seemed genuinely engaged in their work, capable of fixing just about anything. Now, it feels like we’re living in a world where everything is designed to be tossed aside the moment it stops working. This is partly the fault of companies, with their often unnecessarily complex designs that make repairs seem not worth the time and cost, especially when relatively cheap replacement parts are readily available. With over 8 billion people on this planet, the pressure to consume is insane, and it’s taking a toll on our environment.</p>

<p>Take smartphones, for example. Every year, millions of shiny new devices hit the market, and they’re often built to last just long enough for us to want the next big thing. I can’t tell you how many friends I’ve seen ditch perfectly good phones just because they wanted the latest model. I’ve been guilty of this too. It’s like we’ve forgotten how to appreciate what we have. I can’t help but think about how my childhood was filled with fixing things, not just throwing them away or replacing them with something new.</p>

<p>The idea of replacing rather than repairing has increasingly penetrated our personal lives. In a world where everything revolves around speed—think online shopping and instant messaging—patience seems to be a thing of the past. When a friendship hits a rough patch, it’s all too easy to walk away instead of putting in the effort to mend it. It feels like we’ve adopted a “replace it” mindset for our connections, just as we do with our gadgets. Sure, technology has made life easier in many ways, but it has also made us a little lazy when it comes to nurturing our relationships. We’re so focused on quick fixes that we forget the beauty of taking our time to understand one another. It’s a shame because the effort we invest in repairing our bonds can potentially lead to some of the most rewarding experiences in life, admittedly not always though.</p>

<p>So, what’s the takeaway? There might not be one! This was more of a personal reflection and perhaps a bit of an infatuation with nostalgia. However, I believe that as we navigate this fast-paced world, it’s important to remember the value of repair—both in our belongings and our relationships. Embracing the art of fixing things can help us cultivate deeper connections and a more sustainable lifestyle. It’s all about finding that balance between convenience and care. Let’s bring back the joy of repair, one gadget and one relationship at a time.</p>
