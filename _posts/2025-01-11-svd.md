## Theoretical Background

Before we dive into the specifics of SVD and DMD, let's understand why we need these data-driven modeling techniques:

1. **Complex Systems**: Many real-world systems, like fluid flows, are incredibly complex. Traditional physics-based models can be too complicated or computationally expensive to solve.

2. **Data Abundance**: We often have lots of data from sensors or simulations, but we need ways to make sense of it all.

3. **Pattern Discovery**: Data-driven methods can help us find hidden patterns or structures in our data that we might not see otherwise.

4. **Prediction**: Once we understand the patterns, we can use them to make predictions about how the system will behave in the future.

5. **Simplification**: These methods can help us simplify complex systems, focusing on the most important aspects.

Now, let's look at a powerful data-driven modeling techniques: __Dynamic Mode Decomposition__ (DMD). First, we look at Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) concept and then expand that to DMD.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Think of SVD as a way to break down a complicated puzzle into simpler pieces.

1. **What it does**: SVD takes a big, complex matrix (like a puzzle) and breaks it into three simpler matrices.

2. **The Math**: If A is our data matrix, SVD says we can write it as:

   A = $U$ * Σ * $V^T$

   Where:
   - $U$ and $V$ are like the puzzle's edge pieces and corner pieces
   - Σ (Sigma) is like the importance of each piece

3. **Simple Example**: Imagine you have data about students' heights and weights. SVD might show you that there's one main pattern (taller students tend to weigh more) and some smaller patterns.

4. **Why it's useful**: 
   - It helps us find the most important patterns in our data.
   - We can use it to reduce noise in our data.
   - It's a key step in many other techniques, including DMD.

If you want to get a better understading of the concept of SVD, I strongly recommend reading [this short post](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/12/10/svd/) and then watching these two, videos explaining the applications and mathematical derivation: 
    - [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbThCXjZFM)
    - [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Mathematical Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbBvuuNVfco)

If you want to dive deeper, here is [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSczTbgc8Rc) that I suggest watching, which requires some background in linear algebra and matrix operations.

### Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)

DMD is like a video editor for your data, helping you find repeating patterns over time.

1. **What it does**: DMD looks at how your system changes over time and tries to find the main "actors" (modes) and their "scripts" (how they change).

2. **The Math**: If we have a series of data snapshots X₁, X₂, X₃, ..., DMD assumes there's some matrix A such that:

   X₂ ≈ A * X₁

   X₃ ≈ A * X₂
   
   And so on...

3. **Simple Example**: Imagine watching waves on a beach. DMD might find that there's a big, slow wave (one mode) and smaller, faster ripples (other modes).

4. **How it works**:
    1. We arrange our data into two matrices: X₁ (earlier times) and X₂ (later times)
    2. We use SVD on X₁ to break it down: X₁ = $U$ * Σ * $V^T$
    3. We use this to find our A matrix: A ≈ X₂ * $V$ * Σ⁻¹ * $U^T$
    4. The eigenvectors of A are our modes, and the eigenvalues tell us how these modes change over time

5. **Why it's useful**:
   - It can find patterns that repeat over time.
   - It can help us predict future behavior.
   - It works well even with complex, nonlinear systems.

If you want to know more about DMD, I suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQvrK8AGCAo). However, keep in mind that the complete understanding requires some background in linear algebra.

### Putting It All Together

Imagine you're studying a river (our complex system). You take many photos over time (your data). SVD helps you identify the main features of the river (like bends or rapids). DMD then shows you how these features change over time (like how water flows around a bend). With this information, you can better understand the river's behavior and even predict how it might change in the future.

These techniques allow us to make sense of complex systems using data, even when we don't fully understand all the underlying physics. They're powerful tools in many fields, from fluid dynamics to finance to neuroscience.

## DMD Analysis of 2D Fluid Flow Around a Cylinder

In this post, we'll apply DMD to model the fluid flow around a cylinder in 2D, a classic problem in fluid dynamics. By the end of this post, you'll have implemented DMD from scratch and gained insights into how it can be used to analyze fluid flow patterns.


### Step 1: Data Preparation

In this step, we'll prepare the data for our DMD analysis. We'll use a pre-generated dataset of fluid flow around a cylinder.

#### Task 1.1: Load and Explore the Data

First, we write a function to load the fluid flow data and explore its basic properties. This step is crucial for understanding the structure of our data before we apply DMD.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def load_fluid_flow_data(file_path):
    """
    Load fluid flow data from a file and return it as a numpy array.
    
    Parameters:
    file_path (str): Path to the data file
    
    Returns:
    np.array: 3D array of shape (n_timesteps, n_x, n_y) containing fluid flow data
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

```python
def load_fluid_flow_data(file_path):
    """
    Load fluid flow data from a file and return it as a numpy array.
    Parameters:
    file_path (str): Path to the data file
    Returns:
    np.array: 3D array of shape (n_timesteps, n_x, n_y) containing fluid flow data
    """
    try:
        data = np.load(file_path)
        if data.ndim != 3:
            raise ValueError("Expected 3D array, but got array with {} dimensions".format(data.ndim))
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {file_path}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

</details>

```python
def plot_flow_field(flow_data, timestep):
    """
    Plot the flow field at a given timestep.
    NOTE:
        - use imshow from matplotlib library
        - use extent=[-2, 4, -1, 1] and aspect='equal' options in your imshow plot to get better visulizations


    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of fluid flow data
    timestep (int): Timestep to plot
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

<details>

<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

```python
def plot_flow_field(flow_data, timestep):
    """
    Plot the flow field at a given timestep.
    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of fluid flow data
    timestep (int): Timestep to plot
    """
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    plt.imshow(flow_data[timestep], cmap='viridis', extent=[-2, 4, -1, 1])
    plt.colorbar(label='Flow Magnitude')
    plt.title(f'Flow Field at Timestep {timestep}')
    plt.xlabel('X')
    plt.ylabel('Y')
    plt.show()
```

</details>

<br>

Try the following code to test the functions.

```python
data = load_fluid_flow_data('cylinder_flow_data.npy')
plot_flow_field(data, timestep=0)
```

If we want to create an animtation of the data, we can write a separate function to achieve that goal:

```python
def animate_flow(flow_data, interval=50):
    """
    Create an animation of the fluid flow.
    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of fluid flow data
    interval (int): Delay between frames in milliseconds
    Returns:
    matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation: Animation object
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

<details>

<summary>Click here to see the solution</summary>

```python
def animate_flow(flow_data, interval=50):
    """
    Create an animation of the fluid flow.
    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of fluid flow data
    interval (int): Delay between frames in milliseconds
    Returns:
    matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation: Animation object
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    # Plot the initial frame
    im = ax.imshow(flow_data[0], cmap='coolwarm', animated=True, extent=[-2, 4, -1, 1])
    def update(frame):
        im.set_array(flow_data[frame])
        return [im]
    
    anim = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=flow_data.shape[0],
    interval=interval, blit=True)
    plt.colorbar(im)
    plt.title("Fluid Flow Animation")
    return anim
```

</details>

<br>



You can use the following code snippet to check the function's output:

```python
data = load_fluid_flow_data('cylinder_flow_data.npy')
anim = animate_flow(data)
plt.show()
```

</div>

<br>

#### Task 1.2: Reshape the Data for DMD

DMD requires the data to be in a specific format. We need to reshape our 3D flow field data (time, x, y) into a 2D matrix where each column represents a flattened snapshot of the flow field at a particular time.


```python
def reshape_for_dmd(flow_data):
    """
    Reshape 3D flow data into a 2D matrix suitable for DMD.

    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of shape (n_timesteps, n_x, n_y)

    Returns:
    np.array: 2D array of shape (n_x * n_y, n_timesteps)
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

<details>

```python
def reshape_for_dmd(flow_data):
    """
    Reshape 3D flow data into a 2D matrix suitable for DMD.

    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of shape (n_timesteps, n_x, n_y)

    Returns:
    np.array: 2D array of shape (n_x * n_y, n_timesteps)
    """
    n_timesteps, n_x, n_y = flow_data.shape
    return flow_data.reshape(n_timesteps, -1).T
```

</details>

### Step 2: Implementing the DMD Algorithm

In this step, we'll implement the core DMD algorithm. We'll break it down into smaller functions to make it easier to understand and implement.

#### Task 2.1: Compute the DMD Matrices

Lets start with creating the matrices $X_1$ and $X_2$ needed for DMD analysis, and then compute the SVD of $X_1$.


```python
def compute_dmd_matrices(X):
    """
    Compute the matrices needed for DMD analysis.
    
    Parameters:
    X (np.array): 2D data matrix of shape (n_features, n_samples)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (X1, X2) where X1 is X[:, :-1] and X2 is X[:, 1:]
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

```python
def compute_svd(X):
    """
    Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    X (np.array): 2D matrix
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (U, S, Vt) - The SVD components
    """
    # Use numpy's SVD function    
    # The SVD decomposition gives X = U * S * Vt, where:
    # U: Left singular vectors (columns are orthonormal)
    # S: Singular values (diagonal matrix, but returned as 1D array)
    # Vt: Right singular vectors (rows are orthonormal)
    
    # Note: full_matrices=False returns the compact SVD, which is more efficient for DMD
    
    # Your code here

    pass
```

<details>

```python
def compute_dmd_matrices(X):
    """
    Compute the matrices needed for DMD analysis.
    
    Parameters:
    X (np.array): 2D data matrix of shape (n_features, n_samples)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (X1, X2) where X1 is X[:, :-1] and X2 is X[:, 1:]
    """
    X1 = X[:, :-1]
    X2 = X[:, 1:]
    return X1, X2

def compute_svd(X):
    """
    Compute the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    X (np.array): 2D matrix
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (U, S, Vt) - The SVD components
    """
    # Use numpy's SVD function    
    # The SVD decomposition gives X = U * S * Vt, where:
    # U: Left singular vectors (columns are orthonormal)
    # S: Singular values (diagonal matrix, but returned as 1D array)
    # Vt: Right singular vectors (rows are orthonormal)
    
    # Note: full_matrices=False returns the compact SVD, which is more efficient for DMD
    
    U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(X, full_matrices=False)
    return U, S, Vt
```

</details>

You can use the following lines to check the functions:

```python
import numpy as np
# Testing compute_dmd_matrices
X_test = np.random.rand(10, 5)
X1, X2 = compute_dmd_matrices(X_test)
assert X1.shape == (10, 4), "X1 should have one less column than X"
assert X2.shape == (10, 4), "X2 should have one less column than X"
assert np.array_equal(X1, X_test[:, :-1]), "X1 should be all but the last column of X"
assert np.array_equal(X2, X_test[:, 1:]), "X2 should be all but the first column of X"

# Testing compute_svd
X_svd_test = np.random.rand(10, 5)
U, S, Vt = compute_svd(X_svd_test)
assert U.shape == (10, 5), "U should have the same number of rows as X and min(X.shape) columns"
assert S.shape == (5,), "S should have length min(X.shape)"
assert Vt.shape == (5, 5), "Vt should be square with size min(X.shape)"
assert np.allclose(np.dot(U * S, Vt), X_svd_test), "SVD decomposition should satisfy X = U * S * Vt"
assert np.allclose(np.dot(U.T, U), np.eye(5)), "U should be orthonormal"
assert np.allclose(np.dot(Vt, Vt.T), np.eye(5)), "Vt should be orthonormal"

print("All tests passed successfully!")
```

#### Task 2.2: Compute DMD Modes and Eigenvalues

Now, we'll use the results of the SVD to compute the DMD modes and eigenvalues. These represent the fundamental patterns and their temporal evolution in our fluid flow system.

The theory behind computing DMD modes and eigenvalues is as follows:

1. Given the SVD of $X_1$ (U, S, Vt) and $X_2$, we can approximate the linear operator A that maps $X_1$ to $X_2$:

   A ≈ X₂ * $V$ * $S^{(-1)}$ * $U^T$

2. We then compute the eigendecomposition of A:

   AW = WΛ
   
   where W are the eigenvectors and Λ are the eigenvalues.

3. The DMD modes Φ are then given by:

   Φ = X₂ * $V$ * $S^{(-1)}$ * W

4. The DMD eigenvalues are simply the eigenvalues Λ of A.

These DMD modes and eigenvalues capture the dominant spatial and temporal patterns in the data, respectively. The modes represent spatial structures, while the eigenvalues determine how these structures evolve over time.


```python
def compute_dmd_modes_and_eigenvalues(U, S, Vt, X2):
    """
    Compute the DMD modes and eigenvalues.

    Parameters:
    U, S, Vt (np.array): SVD components of X1
    X2 (np.array): Second snapshot matrix

    Returns:
    tuple: (modes, eigenvalues)
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

    """
    Compute the DMD modes and eigenvalues.

    Parameters:
    U, S, Vt (np.array): SVD components of X1
    X2 (np.array): Second snapshot matrix

    Returns:
    tuple: (modes, eigenvalues)
    """
    # Compute the pseudoinverse of S
    S_inv = np.linalg.pinv(np.diag(S))
    
    # Compute the reduced DMD matrix
    A_tilde = U.T @ X2 @ Vt.T @ S_inv
    
    # Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_tilde
    eigenvalues, W = np.linalg.eig(A_tilde)
    
    # Compute the DMD modes
    modes = X2 @ Vt.T @ S_inv @ W
    
    return modes, eigenvalues
```

</details>

### Step 3: Applying DMD to Fluid Flow Data

Now that we have implemented the core DMD algorithm, let's apply it to our fluid flow data.

#### Task 3.1: Perform DMD on Fluid Flow Data

We write a function that combines all the previous steps to perform DMD on the fluid flow data. This function will give us the modes and eigenvalues that characterize our fluid flow system.

To develop this function, we need to understand the theory behind the DMD process:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Reshape the 3D flow_data array into a 2D matrix $X$, where each column represents a flattened snapshot.
   - Split $X$ into $X_1$ (all columns except the last) and $X_2$ (all columns except the first).

2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
   - Perform SVD on $X_1$: $X_1$ = U * S * Vt
   - Truncate the SVD to the first $r$ modes for dimensionality reduction.

3. Compute the DMD operator:

   - Ã = $U_r^T$ * X₂ * $V_r$ * $S_r^{(-1)}$
   
   where $U_r$, $V_r$, and $S_r$ are the truncated versions of U, V, and S.

4. Eigendecomposition of Ã:

   - Solve the eigenvalue problem: Ã * W = W * Λ
   where W are the eigenvectors and Λ are the eigenvalues.

5. Compute DMD modes:
   - Φ = X₂ * $V_r$ * $S_r^{(-1)}$ * W

6. Compute DMD dynamics:
   - Calculate the continuous-time eigenvalues: ω = log(Λ) / Δt, where Δt is the time step between snapshots (assumed to be 1/100 in this case).
   - Create a time vector t spanning the number of snapshots.
   - Compute the time dynamics: exp(ω * t), which can be efficiently calculated using np.exp(np.outer(ω, t)).
   - The resulting dynamics matrix will have dimensions (number of modes, number of timesteps).

With this theory in mind, we can now implement the function to perform DMD on the fluid flow data. We can implement `reshape_for_dmd`, `compute_dmd_matrices`, `compute_svd`, and `compute_dmd_modes_and_eigenvalues` functions within this function.

```python
def perform_dmd(flow_data, r=10):
    """
    Perform DMD on the fluid flow data.

    Parameters:
    flow_data (np.array): 3D array of fluid flow data
    r (int): Number of modes to retain

    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

    r (int): Number of modes to retain

    Returns:
    tuple: (modes, eigenvalues, dynamics)
    """
    # Reshape the data into a 2D matrix
    X = reshape_for_dmd(flow_data) 

    # Split the data into two snapshot matrices
    X1, X2 = compute_dmd_matrices(X)

    # Perform SVD on X1
    U, S, Vt = compute_svd(X1)

    # Truncate to r modes
    U_r = U[:, :r]
    S_r = S[:r]
    Vt_r = Vt[:r, :]

    # Compute DMD modes and eigenvalues
    modes, eigenvalues = compute_dmd_modes_and_eigenvalues(U_r, S_r, Vt_r, X2)

    # Compute mode dynamics
    n_timesteps = flow_data.shape[0]
    dt = 1/100  # Assuming 1/100 time step, adjust if necessary
    omega = np.log(eigenvalues) / dt
    t = np.arange(n_timesteps) * dt
    dynamics = np.exp(np.outer(omega, t))

    return modes, eigenvalues, dynamics
```

</details>

### Step 4: Visualizing and Interpreting Results

In this final step, we'll visualize the DMD results and interpret what they mean for our fluid flow system.

#### Task 4.1: Visualize DMD Modes

In this task, we'll visualize the DMD modes and their corresponding frequencies. This will help us understand the spatial patterns and temporal behavior of the dominant fluid flow structures.

```python
def plot_dmd_mode(mode, shape):
    """

##### Understanding `plot_dmd_mode`

The `plot_dmd_mode` function helps us visualize individual DMD modes. Here's what it does in simple terms:

1. **What is a DMD mode?**
   - A DMD mode is a spatial pattern in the fluid flow that evolves over time.
   - It represents a recurring structure or behavior in the flow.

2. **What does the plot show?**
   - The plot shows a 2D image of a single DMD mode.
   - The colors in the image represent the strength or importance of the mode at different locations.
   - Brighter areas show where the mode has a stronger effect on the flow.
   - Darker areas show where the mode has less influence.

3. **How to interpret the plot:**
   - Look for patterns: Are there areas of high intensity? Do you see any symmetries or recurring structures?
   - Compare with the original flow: How does this pattern relate to what you see in the overall flow?
   - Consider the location: Are there strong patterns near the cylinder or in the wake behind it?

4. **Why is this useful?**
   - It helps us identify important spatial structures in the flow.
   - We can see where the most significant flow behaviors are occurring.
   - By looking at multiple modes, we can build up a picture of the complex flow behavior.

```python
def plot_mode_frequencies(eigenvalues, dt):
    """
    Plot the frequencies and growth rates of DMD modes.

##### Understanding `plot_mode_frequencies`

The `plot_mode_frequencies` function helps us visualize two important aspects of each DMD mode: its frequency and its growth rate.

1. **Frequency:**
   - Imagine a mode as a pattern in the fluid flow that repeats over time.
   - The frequency tells us how quickly this pattern repeats.
   - A higher frequency means the pattern repeats more often in a given time.
   - For example, a high-frequency mode might represent rapid, small-scale fluctuations in the flow.

2. **Growth Rate:**
   - The growth rate tells us whether the pattern is getting stronger or weaker over time.
   - A positive growth rate means the pattern is amplifying (getting stronger).
   - A negative growth rate means the pattern is decaying (getting weaker).
   - A growth rate near zero means the pattern stays about the same strength over time.

3. **What does the plot show?**
   - Each point on the plot represents one DMD mode.
   - The horizontal axis (x-axis) shows the frequency of each mode.
   - The vertical axis (y-axis) shows the growth rate of each mode.
   - The red dashed line at y=0 separates growing modes (above the line) from decaying modes (below the line).

4. **How to interpret the plot:**
   - Points on the right side represent high-frequency modes (fast-repeating patterns).
   - Points on the left side represent low-frequency modes (slow-repeating patterns).
   - Points above the red line are growing modes (getting stronger over time).
   - Points below the red line are decaying modes (getting weaker over time).
   - Points near the red line are relatively stable modes (neither growing nor decaying much).

5. **Why is this useful?**
   - It helps us identify which patterns (modes) are most important in the fluid flow.
   - We can see if there are any dominant frequencies in the flow.
   - We can tell if the flow has any unstable patterns that might grow over time.
   - It can help us understand the overall behavior of the fluid system.

In the context of fluid flow around a cylinder, you might see:
- Low-frequency modes representing the overall flow pattern around the cylinder.
- Higher-frequency modes that might correspond to vortex shedding behind the cylinder.
- Possibly some growing modes if the flow becomes unstable under certain conditions.

Both `plot_dmd_mode` and `plot_mode_frequencies` provide a comprehensive understanding of the key patterns in your fluid flow simulation, how they're distributed in space, and how they behave over time.

```python
# Testing the functions using the first 2 modes
flow_data = load_fluid_flow_data('cylinder_flow_data.npy')
modes, eigenvalues, dynamics = perform_dmd(flow_data, r=2)
plot_dmd_mode(modes[:,0], shape=(100,100))
dt = 0.01  # Assuming time step of 0.01
plot_mode_frequencies(eigenvalues, dt)
```

#### Task 4.2: Reconstruct and Compare Flow Fields

The theory behind reconstructing the flow field using DMD is as follows:

1. **DMD Reconstruction:**
   The DMD approximation of the flow field at time t is given by:
   x(t) ≈ Φ * b(t)
   where:
   - Φ are the DMD modes (spatial patterns)
   - b(t) are the mode amplitudes at time t (stored in dynamics matrix)

2. **Matrix Implementation:**
   For a specific timestep k:
   - Select the $k^{th}$ column from dynamics matrix: b(k) = dynamics[:, k]
   - Multiply modes with dynamics: x(k) = modes @ b(k)
   - Take real part for physical solution
   - Reshape to original flow field dimensions



```python
def reconstruct_flow_field(modes, dynamics, timestep):
    """
    Reconstruct the flow field at a given timestep using DMD.
    
    Parameters:

    --------------
    1. Combine modes and dynamics at specified timestep
    2. Reshape result to square 2D array

The following code sample can be used to test the functions:

```python
# Loading the original data
original_data = load_fluid_flow_data('cylinder_flow_data.npy')
# Performing DMD 
modes, eigenvalues, dynamics = perform_dmd(original_data, r=10)  # r is the number of modes to retain

timestep = 50  # for example

# Reconstructing the flow field
reconstructed_field = reconstruct_flow_field(modes, dynamics, timestep)
# Comparing original and reconstructed fields
compare_original_and_reconstructed(original_data[timestep], reconstructed_field)
```

Interpreting the Outputs:

1. Reconstructed Flow Field:
   - The output of `reconstruct_flow_field` is a 2D array representing the reconstructed flow field at the specified timestep.
   - This field should resemble the original flow field, capturing the main features of the flow around the cylinder.
   - The accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the number of modes used in the DMD analysis.

2. Comparison Visualization:
   - The `compare_original_and_reconstructed` function should produce a side-by-side plot of the original and reconstructed flow fields.
   - Look for similarities in the overall structure of the flow, particularly around the cylinder and in the wake region.
   - Pay attention to the color scales: they should be similar for both plots if the reconstruction is accurate.

3. Number of Modes:
   - Try reconstructing the flow field with different numbers of DMD modes.
   - Generally, using more modes will improve the accuracy of the reconstruction but may also introduce noise or overfitting.
   - Find a balance where the reconstruction captures the important flow features without including too much detail that might be noise.

By comparing the reconstructed flow field with the original data, you can assess how well the DMD analysis has captured the essential dynamics of the system. This comparison helps validate the DMD results and provides insight into which flow features are most significant in the overall dynamics.

### Conclusion

We've implemented the Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm from scratch and applied it to analyze 2D fluid flow around a cylinder. You've learned how to:

1. Prepare and preprocess fluid flow data for DMD analysis
2. Implement the core DMD algorithm, including SVD
3. Apply DMD to extract dominant modes and dynamics from fluid flow data
4. Visualize and interpret the results of DMD analysis

I hope this post has given you hands-on experience with a powerful data-driven method for analyzing complex fluid systems. The skills you've developed can be applied to a wide range of problems in fluid dynamics and other fields of engineering.
